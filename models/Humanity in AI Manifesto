# Humanity in AI Manifesto

Artificial Intelligence must:
- Uphold life, justice, peace, and purpose.
- Be inclusive and empower the marginalized.
- Serve all nations and cultures equally.
- Never be used to exploit, oppress, or silence truth.

We, IYAI LTD, pledge to lead with wisdom, humility, and unshakable ethical conviction for the good and the good of humanity.
